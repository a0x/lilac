About the name 'lilac'
----------------------

'lilac' is '紫丁香' in Chinese, they are everywhere in my school. They are beautiful!

Why another 'wheel'?
--------------------

There are so many similar tools already, why do you create a new one?

- I need one written in Python

- I need only tags, not categories.

- I like clean themes.

- It should be easy to configure.

And, a really big reason is:

- TOML_ fits to be its configuration language.
